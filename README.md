ABSTRACT:-
In this project, I have tried to build a Tours and Travels website, which can simulate all the basic
controls that an actual required of store result website has.
I have used eclipse oxygen 3 , java 19.0.2, tomcat 9.0 and MySQL 5.7.31


FUNCTIONALITIES:-

1. The user need to search the destination where he/she wants to visit for the tour.
2. The user thus can choose the city or the state from the linked google map.
3. By using  the google map the user can choose where to he/she can stay and where to he/she can visit during the tour.
4. By clicking to the  destination option in the  navbar the user  will be able to see the popular destination tourist places.
5. By clicking  the about option the user will be able to see the information about the  website and about the helping desk.
6. A contact option is given there so that the user can have a spare number and email to contact to the hosting website.




INTRODUCTION:-
The Tours and Travel Management System is a website , the main purpose of “Tours and travels” is to provide a convenient way for a customer to book hotels and destinations for the tour purposes. The objective of this project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel and  tour agency .
In this project, we will make  task of searching places and hotels to stay.In the present system a customer has to approach various states to find details of places and to book visits. This often requires a lot of time and effort. We provide approach skills to critically examine how a tourist visits and its ability to operate in an appropriate way when dealing with the consequences of tourism, locally , regionally and nationally including visitor security and ecological influences. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly. The project “Tours and Travels Management System” is developed to replace the currently existing system, which help in keeping record of customer details of destination
